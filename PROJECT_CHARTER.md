## **2. Project Sponsor**  
**UNICEF Venture Fund**  

## **3. Project Manager**  
[Your Name or Designated Project Lead]  

## **4. Project Purpose & Justification**  
Bitz ITC is developing an **AI and ML-powered Open Source call management system** to support call centers assisting survivors of **gender-based violence (GBV) and violence against children (VAC)**. The project aims to improve efficiency in handling cases by leveraging **AI for transcription, translation, and case prediction**.  

The system has already been deployed in **Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, and Lesotho**. This investment will enable further enhancements, particularly in **voice recognition, translation into regional languages, and AI-driven case analytics** to support expansion into new countries.  

## **5. Project Objectives**  
- Develop an advanced AI model for **voice recognition (speech-to-text)**.  
- Implement **automated translation** for non-English languages to improve accessibility.  
- Develop **NLP-based case prediction** to classify and analyze case data.  
- Build **workflow automation** using Celery for efficient task execution.  
- Establish a **centralized data storage system** with rich visualization capabilities.  

## **6. Project Scope**  
### **In-Scope:**  
- AI-powered **transcription, translation, and case classification**.  
- **Deployment and scaling** in new regions.  
- **Integration** with existing case management systems.  
- **Data storage and analytics** for insights and reporting.  

### **Out-of-Scope:**  
- Direct case handling or intervention.  
- Development of proprietary AI models (only open-source models will be used).  
- Non-digital case management processes.  

## **7. Key Deliverables**  
- **AI-powered call management system** with transcription, translation, and case prediction.  
- **Scalable and secure cloud-based infrastructure** for call data processing.  
- **Automated workflows and case tracking system**.  
- **Comprehensive data analytics and visualization platform**.
