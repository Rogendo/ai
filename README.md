# AI-Powered Voice Processing & Case Prediction

This project is designed to provide an advanced solution for voice processing and case prediction. By leveraging AI models, we aim to automate transcription, translation, and case predictions, making case management more efficient and accurate.

## Features
- **Voice Recognition**: Convert speech to text using state-of-the-art speech-to-text models.
- **Translation**: Translate non-English text into English for broader accessibility.
- **NLP-Based Case Prediction**: Utilize natural language processing (NLP) models to predict case outcomes and classify case categories.
- **Workflow Automation**: Orchestrate and automate tasks throughout the pipeline using tools like Celery for efficient execution.
- **Data Storage & Visualization**: Store processed data in a centralized location and provide rich data visualizations for better insights.

## Repository Structure

The project is organized into the following key directories:

### 1. **`data_pipeline/`**  
Handles all aspects of data processing, from raw data ingestion to final storage and preparation for machine learning models.  
- **`ingestion/`**: Fetches and preprocesses raw voice data.
- **`transcription/`**: Converts voice recordings into text.
- **`translation/`**: Translates transcribed text into English.
- **`nlp/`**: Applies natural language processing to classify and predict case outcomes.
- **`orchestration/`**: Manages the workflow using Celery or other orchestration tools.
- **`storage/`**: Handles storage of data (e.g., MinIO, S3).

### 2. **`models/`**  
Contains AI models used in the pipeline for transcription, translation, and case prediction.  
- **`voice_recognition/`**: Models for converting speech to text.
- **`translation/`**: AI-based translation models.
- **`case_prediction/`**: NLP models for case classification and outcome prediction.
- **`fine_tuning/`**: Fine-tuning models for domain-specific tasks.

### 3. **`backend/`**  
API services and management of backend operations, such as authentication, logging, and serving model predictions.  
- **`api/`**: Handles REST API requests for interacting with the system.
- **`authentication/`**: Manages user authentication and authorization.
- **`logging/`**: Logs events, errors, and application metrics for monitoring.

### 4. **`frontend/`**  
User interface for visualization of data and case insights. Built with modern web technologies (Vue.js/React).  
- **`ui/`**: Frontend components for building the user interface.
- **`dashboard/`**: The dashboard for displaying processed data and insights from the models.

### 5. **`infrastructure/`**  
Contains configurations for deploying and scaling the application.  
- **`docker/`**: Dockerfiles and Docker Compose configurations.
- **`k8s/`**: Kubernetes deployment files for scaling and orchestration.
- **`ci_cd/`**: Continuous integration and deployment setup (e.g., GitHub Actions, Jenkins).

### 6. **`docs/`**  
Documentation related to the project.  
- **`api_docs/`**: API endpoints and documentation.
- **`research/`**: Notes and research findings regarding model architectures, algorithms, and testing.
- **`compliance/`**: Legal, regulatory, and data privacy compliance documentation.

### 7. **`tests/`**  
Unit and integration tests to ensure the integrity of the system.  
- **`backend/`**: API tests using pytest.
- **`models/`**: Tests for AI models to validate accuracy and performance.
- **`pipeline/`**: Tests for data processing steps in the pipeline.

### 8. **`scripts/`**  
Utility and helper scripts for automating common tasks and data processing.  
- **`data_cleanup.py`**: Script to clean raw input data.
- **`model_runner.py`**: Script to run and test AI models.
