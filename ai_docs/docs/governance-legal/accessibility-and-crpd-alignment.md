# Accessibility & CRPD Alignment Statement for OpenCHS

**Last Updated:** October 1, 2025

Bitz IT Consulting Ltd. is committed to ensuring that the OpenCHS (Open Child Helpline System) is accessible to the widest possible audience, including persons with disabilities. This commitment is rooted in our alignment with the principles of the **United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD)**.

We believe that technology intended for public good must be inclusive by design. This statement outlines how we address accessibility in the OpenCHS platform.

### 1. Our Commitment to Accessibility

We strive to ensure that all users, regardless of their physical or cognitive abilities, can effectively use the OpenCHS platform. Our goal is to create a user experience that is equitable, functional, and inclusive.

### 2. Alignment with the UNCRPD

The CRPD emphasizes non-discrimination, equality of opportunity, and full participation in society for persons with disabilities. OpenCHS aligns with these principles in the following ways:

- **Article 9 (Accessibility):** We are actively working to make our digital platform accessible, enabling persons with disabilities to access information and use our system on an equal basis with others.
- **Article 21 (Freedom of expression and opinion, and access to information):** By ensuring our platform is accessible, we facilitate the ability of users with disabilities to seek, receive, and impart information.

### 3. Key Accessibility Features

We have incorporated several features into the design and development of OpenCHS to enhance accessibility:

- **Mobile-First and Responsive Design:** The user interface is designed to be fully functional on a wide range of devices, including low-bandwidth mobile phones, which are often critical tools for users in the field.
- **Multilingual Support:** The UI can be translated into multiple languages, ensuring that language is not a barrier to use. This is critical for deployments in a diverse linguistic context like Uganda, Kenya, Tanzania, and Lesotho.
- **Screen-Reader Compatibility:** We aim for compatibility with common screen readers. Our development practices include using semantic HTML, ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) landmarks, and providing text alternatives for non-text content where applicable.
- **Keyboard Navigation:** We are working to ensure all functionality can be accessed using a keyboard, without reliance on a mouse.
- **Clear and Simple UI:** The user interface is designed to be clean and uncluttered, with clear headings and a logical flow to reduce cognitive load.

### 4. Reasonable Accommodations

We recognize that accessibility is an ongoing journey. For implementing organizations that require specific reasonable accommodations for staff with disabilities, we are committed to working collaboratively to find solutions. This may include providing documentation in alternative formats or exploring integrations with specific assistive technologies.

### 5. Inclusive Data Handling

Our commitment to the CRPD also extends to how data related to disability is handled.

- **Dignified Language:** We encourage the use of person-first language (e.g., "a child with a disability" rather than "a disabled child") in all case notes and system fields.
- **Confidentiality:** Information about a person's disability is treated as sensitive data and is protected with the highest level of security and confidentiality.

### 6. Continuous Improvement and Feedback

We are continuously seeking to improve the accessibility of OpenCHS. We welcome feedback from users and accessibility experts. If you encounter any accessibility barriers or have suggestions for improvement, please contact us.
