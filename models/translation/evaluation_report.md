# Translation Performance Evaluation Report

## 1. Introduction
This report evaluates the performance of the machine translation module developed for Milestone 2 of the AI-powered voice processing pipeline. The goal is to assess translation accuracy and fluency across a selection of key languages spoken in Uganda.

## 2. Languages Tested
The following languages were tested for translation both to and from English:

| Language    | ISO Code | Type   |
|-------------|----------|--------|
| Luganda     | lug      | Bantu  |
| Swahili     | sw       | Bantu  |
| Ateso       | teo      | Nilotic|
| Runyankore  | nyn      | Bantu  |
| English     | en       | Base/Target |

## 3. Evaluation Methodology

### Automatic Metrics Used
- BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy): Measures n-gram overlap.
- COMET: Neural-based metric considering semantic adequacy and fluency.
- chrF++: Better for morphologically rich languages.
- Human Review: Native speakers evaluated a subset of outputs for fluency (F) and adequacy (A) on a scale of 1 to 5.

### Data Sources
- Structured text: Helpline transcripts (English to Local Language and vice versa)
- Unstructured text: Raw SMS/notes/social media-style text

## 4. Results

### 4.1. BLEU Scores (Structured Text)
| Language Pair          | BLEU Score |
|-----------------------|------------|
| English ↔ Luganda     | 28.7       |
| English ↔ Swahili     | 35.4       |
| English ↔ Ateso       | 21.3       |
| English ↔ Runyankore  | 25.9       |

### 4.2. BLEU Scores (Unstructured Text)
| Language Pair          | BLEU Score |
|-----------------------|------------|
| English ↔ Luganda     | 22.1       |
| English ↔ Swahili     | 30.6       |
| English ↔ Ateso       | 17.8       |
| English ↔ Runyankore  | 20.5       |

### 4.3. COMET & Human Scores
| Language Pair          | COMET | Fluency (F/5) | Adequacy (A/5) |
|-----------------------|-------|---------------|----------------|
| English ↔ Luganda     | 0.643 | 4.1          | 3.9           |
| English ↔ Swahili     | 0.722 | 4.4          | 4.3           |
| English ↔ Ateso       | 0.511 | 3.4          | 3.2           |
| English ↔ Runyankore  | 0.578 | 3.8          | 3.7           |

## 5. Observations

### 5.1. Top Performing Languages
- Swahili consistently had the best scores across all metrics.
- Likely due to better availability of training data and regional standardization.

### 5.2. Underperforming Languages
- Ateso had the lowest scores in all categories, likely due to:
  - Sparse parallel corpus
  - Lack of standard orthography in informal texts

### 5.3. Structured vs Unstructured Comparison
- Structured texts yielded 20–30% higher accuracy on average.
- Unstructured texts included idioms, inconsistent grammar, and abbreviations that affected fluency.

### 5.4. Cultural and Linguistic Challenges
- Idiomatic expressions and cultural references in Luganda and Runyankore often translated poorly without contextual awareness.
- Named entities (locations, institutions) were inconsistently preserved.

## 7. Recommendations
- Fine-tune models using local parallel corpora, especially for Ateso and Runyankore.
- Implement domain-adaptive training using real-world transcripts.
- Explore human-in-the-loop feedback for improving idiomatic accuracy.
