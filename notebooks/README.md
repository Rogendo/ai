## Best Practices

1. **Naming Convention**: Use descriptive names with dates (e.g., `2024-01-15_model_training_experiment.ipynb`)
2. **Version Control**: Keep notebooks clean and well-documented for version control
3. **Documentation**: Include clear markdown explanations in each notebook
4. **Modularity**: Break complex analyses into smaller, focused notebooks
5. **Dependencies**: Document required libraries and versions at the top of each notebook
6. **Data Paths**: Use relative paths and environment variables for data locations

## Getting Started

1. Start with data exploration in `01_data_exploration/`
2. Move through the numbered folders sequentially for your main workflow
3. Use domain-specific folders for specialized tasks
4. Keep experiments and research separate from production code
5. Document your findings in the reports folder

Happy coding! ðŸš€
